# React blog demo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

run `npm install` and `npm start`

About a day spent all in all, and though there's much more that could/should have been added, I think I hit most of the marks up to the JWT authentication. I hope this gives a decent idea of where I am with the required techs.

TODOS: second api call to get author name, JWT token handling, testing.
